# Decorator-Pattern

- Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add new behavior to an existing class, without modifying the original class.
- It's more flexible than inheritance.
- Supports the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concerns

## Usage
I'm implementing the decorator pattern for caching strategy in this repository within a Product API HttpClient.
